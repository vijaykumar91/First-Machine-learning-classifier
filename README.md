"# First-Machine-learning-classifier" 
This is the simple machine learning problem, I would try to explain how to machine learning problem work if you are bigners.

Data Sample :
#   wait ----     texture ---  label
#   150g           Bumpy        Orange
#   170g           Bumpy        Orange
#   140g           Smooth       Apple
#   130g           Smooth       Apple

This is the some basic data for performing the Machine learning algorith.


Just run the code and predict the result.
Note: If we have more data then we can develop best classifier.

Thanks!
